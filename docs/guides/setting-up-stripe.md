# Setting up Stripe

## Prerequisites

The following steps require a ReqHub account. Make sure you're logged in by [signing in](https://reqhub.io/login) or [signing up](https://reqhub.io/create-account).

----

## Connect with Stripe

To make money selling your APIs, you will need to set up a Stripe account.
If you haven't set up Stripe yet, you should see a button on your dashboard, on the page for an API, or you can find it in the [account section](https://dev.reqhub.io/account).

Follow the screens to complete Stripe's onboarding process.

**Note:** Stripe may ask for sensitive information, but that information stays with Stripe and is not visible to ReqHub or SpaceGiraffe, LLC. We don't want it anyway &#x2764;

Once that's completed, you can set up pricing.

## Adding pricing plans

On your API pages, you should now see a button to add pricing plans under the &#x1F4B3; **Plans & pricing** section.

![Add a pricing plan](https://reqhubprod.blob.core.windows.net/public/docs/add-pricing-plan.png)

Fill out the form with the pricing details you want. You can set up pricing for recurring billing, per-request usage-based pricing, and trial periods.

Once you've created some plans, they'll look something like this to other users.
