# Publish to the Marketplace

#### Prerequisites

The following steps require a ReqHub account. Make sure you're logged in by [signing in](https://reqhub.io/login) or [signing up](https://reqhub.io/create-account).

If you're interested in monetizing your API, you can follow our guide on [setting up Stripe](guides/setting-up-stripe).

This guide assumes you have created an API, or are in the process of creating one. See our [quickstart guide](getting-started/quickstart) for more information.

----

## APIs are public by default

While editing an API, set the `Private` checkbox to un-checked. This will cause your API to appear in the marketplace and search results.

## Marketplace options

With your API appearing publicly in the marketplace, there are additional options you can configure to change the appearance or make it easier to find.

Click the `Show all options` button. This will expand the full list of fields you can configure for your API.
These are hidden by default in order to simplify the experience.

Towards the bottom, you'll see a `Marketplace` section where you can change the card appearance, category, and tags.

#### Card images and backgrounds

By default, the card appearance looks like this:

![Default card appearance](https://reqhubprod.blob.core.windows.net/public/docs/default-card-appearance.png)

You can change the logo and background to suit your brand or service. Logos should be `92x92 px` and backgrounds should be at least `576x384 px`.

For example, we used an icon with a gradient for our [email API](https://reqhub.io/SpaceGiraffe/email):

#### Category & tags

You can set the category and tags, which provide additional keywords for users to find your API.

For example, here are the category and tag fields we used for our email API:

![Category and tags form fields for our email API](https://reqhubprod.blob.core.windows.net/public/docs/category-tags.png)

This will cause the email API to appear in searches for the category or any of the tags, like "communication":

#### That's it!

We hope this helps you find a solution that will work for your app.
