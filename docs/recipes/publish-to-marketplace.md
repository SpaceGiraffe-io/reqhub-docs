# Publish to the Marketplace

#### Prerequisites

The following steps require a ReqHub account. Make sure you're logged in by [signing in](https://reqhub.io/login) or [signing up](https://reqhub.io/create-account).

If you're interested in monetizing your API, you can follow our guide on [setting up Stripe](guides/setting-up-stripe).

This guide assumes you have created an API, or are in the process of creating one. See our [quickstart guide](getting-started/quickstart) for more information.

----

## APIs are public by default

While editing an API, set the `Private` checkbox to un-checked. This will cause your API to appear in the marketplace and search results.

## Marketplace options

With your API appearing publicly in the marketplace, there are additional options you can configure to change the appearance or make it easier to find.

Click the `Show all options` button. This will expand the full list of fields you can configure for your API.
These are hidden by default in order to simplify the experience.

Towards the bottom, you'll see a `Marketplace` section where you can change the card appearance, category, and tags.

#### That's it!
