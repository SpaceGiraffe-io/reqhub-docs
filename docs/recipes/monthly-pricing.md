# Set up monthly pricing

#### Prerequisites

The following steps require a ReqHub account. Make sure you're logged in by [signing in](https://reqhub.io/login) or [signing up](https://reqhub.io/create-account).

Additionally, your account needs to be connected with Stripe in order to create pricing plans. Check out our guide on [setting up Stripe](guides/setting-up-stripe.md).

## Make sure Stripe is set up

If you haven't already, [set up Stripe](guides/setting-up-stripe.md). You should see a button like this on your API pages:

You can also find a button in the [account section](https://dev.reqhub.io/account).

## Adding pricing plans

On one of your API pages, you should see a button to add pricing plans.

Fill out the form with the pricing details you want. You can set up pricing for recurring billing, per-request usage-based pricing, and trial periods. If you want more information on pricing, check out our guide on [how pricing works](/guides/how-pricing-works).

#### Biweekly, quarterly, and annual plans

If you're looking to price your API other than monthly, ReqHub also supports subscription intervals of 2 weeks, 3 months, or 1 year.

#### That's it!

Once you've created some plans, they'll look something like this to other users.
