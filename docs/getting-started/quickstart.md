## Prerequisites

The following steps require a ReqHub account. Make sure you're logged in by [signing in](https://reqhub.io/login) or [signing up](https://reqhub.io/create-account).

## Distributing an API

Use the following steps to connect your API to ReqHub.

#### 1. Add your API through the website

Use the `New API` button at the top of the page to create a new API.

Fill out the form and click `Save`. All you really need is a name, but feel free to explore the other options.

#### 2. Grab your publisher keys

With the API created, you will have two sets of keys.
One set is for publishing your API, and the other is for consuming it.
Copy the `Publisher keys` and proceed to the next step.
